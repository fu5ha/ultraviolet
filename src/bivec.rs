//! Bivectors, i.e. oriented areas.
//!
//! A bivector is an *oriented area*, and is equivalent
//! to the result of the exterior (wedge) product of two vectors, i.e.
//! `u ∧ v`. This means it is the *oriented area* of the parallelogram
//! created by attaching two vectors and then extending them into a parallelogram.
//!
//! This may be hard to visualize at first, but bivectors are as fundamental as vectors. If vectors
//! are a representation of *lines*, then bivectors are a representation of *planes*.
//!
//! A normalized bivector can be thought of as representing a plane of rotation and the *direction of rotation*
//! inside that plane such that a *positive* rotation follows the orientation of the bivector. When
//! you obtain a bivector by taking the exterior product of two vectors, the positive direction of rotation
//! is defined as the one that *brings the first vector closer to the second*. For example, a bivector
//! created by taking the exterior product `x ∧ y` of the x and y basis vectors will create a unit
//! bivector that represents the xy plane, with orientation such that a positive rotation of `x` inside
//! the plane would bring `x` closer to `y`. This is why positive rotation is generally defined as
//! "counter clockwise" in 2d, since such a rotation brings `x` to `y`.
//!
//! Much like vectors can be represented as a linear combination of *basis vectors*, i.e.
//! a vector "component representation," bivectors can be represented as a linear combination
//! of *basis bivectors*. If the basis vectors are the unit vectors in the direction of each
//! canonical axis of a space, then the basis bivectors are the *unit area planes* in each of the
//! canonical planes.
//!
//! In 2d, there is only one basis plane, the xy plane, which represents all of 2d space. As such, in 2d
//! there is only *one* basis bivector, while there are *two* basis vectors. This means that a 2d bivector
//! has only one component.
//!
//! In 3d, there are three basis planes, the xy plane, the xz plane, and the yz plane, which are respectively
//! the planes parallel to those combinations of the x, y, and z basis vectors. Therefore, a 3d bivector has
//! three components, each of which represents the *projected area* of that bivector onto one of the three
//! basis bivectors. This is analogous to how vector components represent the *projected length* of that vector
//! onto each unit vector.
